        <b>1D case : </b> If a discrete function takes only the values 0 and 1, begins at the value 0 and ends at the
        value 1, then it must switch values an odd number of times. <a

        A triangulation is an assignment where :
    <ol>
        <li>The vertices each have distinct colouring. Shown here in red (top), blue (bottom left) and green (bottom
            right)</li>
        <li>Each side can take only the 2 colours of thier respective sides.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="thm">
        By Sperner's Lemma, given any triangulation, there is always a smaller triangle with all three colours at its
        vertices (a rainbow triangle). Moreover, the number of such triangles is always odd.
    </p>

    <h2>Proof Stetch</h2>

    <p>
        Connecting the cells across the red-blue edges produces only simple paths and cycles. Paths that end within the
        triangulation correspond to a rainbow triangle (shaded yellow). <br> From the 1D case it follows that <b>only an
            odd number of paths enter the triangle</b> (from the top left side of the
        triangulation).
    </p>
    <img src="img/img1.webp" width="300">
    <p>Only an even number of paths may enter and leave the triangulation from the red-blue side. <b>Number of paths
            entering and terminating within the triangle is still odd </b>(odd - even = odd).</p>

    <img src="img/img2.webp" width="300">

    <p>Paths may terminate within the triangulation but as they do not exit the triangulation, both the starting and
        ending nodes contribute to a rainbow triangle. <b>Thus, such paths contribute an even number of rainbow
            triangles.</b></p>

    <p>From the above 2 cases, we can conclude that the final number of RT's is <b>odd + even = odd.</b> Existence can
        be shown by induction from the n=2 case.</p>
